# clj-dregaut

Naive Clojure implementation of some regular expression and automaton
algorithms from [Martin] \(John Martin, Introduction to Languages and
the Theory of Computation, 4th edition, McGraw-Hill, 2010).

My goals for this project are twofold:

 1. To learn some Clojure.

 2. To make the code resemble the mathematical definitions.

Efficiency is *not* a goal. Indeed, much of the implementation is
highly inefficient.

## Usage

Is discouraged, unless you don't care about efficiency.

## Credits

This project is inspired by [Anders Møller](http://cs.au.dk/~amoeller/)'s
[dRegAut](http://cs.au.dk/~amoeller/dRegAut/doc/index.html) package.
